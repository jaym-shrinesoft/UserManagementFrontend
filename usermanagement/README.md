 The interface will have 3 screens. When a user logs in, they will see a table of all the other users (including themself). There will be a "delete" button against all rows to delete that particular user.
    There will be a button on the top "create a new user". This button will redirect the user to the second screen (Create User Screen) where they will be to create a new user
    Create User Screen: This will be a form that takes the information aligned with the USER entity in the database (username, email, full name, and the role that this user should be assigned). On submit, the CREATE API endpoint will be called which sends the new user an email for them to create a password.
    Create Password Screen: When the new user clicks on the unique link to activate and create a password for their account, they are redirected to this create password screen. They will enter their new password and click on the activate button.
    The user should be able to log in after activating their account.
